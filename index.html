    <!-- this section gives an introduction of the band -->

    <div id="about" class="jumbotron jumbotron-text">The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed.
        <br>Their original line-up consisted of the American actor/musicians Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork with English actor/singer Davy Jones.
        <br>The group was conceived in 1965 by television producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically for the situation comedy series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The band's music was initially supervised by record producer Don
        Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.

                                    In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was taught how
                                    to play properly. By the time the Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself.[5] He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes
                                    making his right leg weak. Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, writers of many of the Monkees' songs, observed quickly that when brought into the studio together, the four actors would try to make each other laugh. Because
                                    of this, the writers often brought in each singer individually. The antics escalated until one time Dolenz poured a cup of Coca-Cola on Don Kirshner's head; at the time, Dolenz did not know Kirshner on sight. According
                                    to Mike Nesmith, Dolenz's voice made the Monkees' sound distinctive,[6] and during tension-filled times, Nesmith and Peter Tork voluntarily turned over lead vocal duties to Dolenz on their own compositions. Dolenz wrote
                                    a few of the band's self-penned songs, most prominent being "Randy Scouse Git" from the album Headquarters. He provided the lead vocals for such hits as "Last Train to Clarksville", "Pleasant Valley Sunday", and "I'm
                                    a Believer". Dolenz also directed and co-wrote the show's final episode.[7] Dolenz purchased the third modular Moog synthesizer sold commercially. (The first two belonged to Wendy Carlos and Buck Owens.) His performance
                                    on the Monkees' song "Daily Nightly" (written by Nesmith), from the album Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd., was one of the first uses of the synthesizer on a rock recording. He eventually sold his instrument
                                    to Bobby Sherman. He is one of two surviving members of the Monkees (after Jones' death in 2012 and Tork's in 2019). He is the only surviving member of the Monkees who has been part of every lineup since the band's
                                    inception, and the only member with contemporary recordings of his vocals on all studio albums.

                                    Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair and teeth were not photogenic.[11] When asked if he knew of someone with a similar "open, Nordic look",
                                    Stills suggested Tork should audition.[12] Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a pop band of the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom. Tork was the oldest member of the group. Tork
                                    was a proficient musician before he joined The Monkees, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he had played what he described as "third chair
                                    guitar" on Michael Nesmith's song "Papa Gene's Blues" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey
                                    Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake". On the show, he was relegated to acting as the "lovable dummy", a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New York's Greenwich
                                    Village.[13] The DVD release of the first season of the show contains commentary from the various bandmates. In it, Nesmith states that Tork was better at playing guitar than bass. In Tork's commentary, he states that
                                    Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather
                                    than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards. Recording and producing as a group was Tork's major interest, and he
                                    hoped that the four members would continue working together as a band on future recordings. However, the four did not have enough in common regarding their musical interests. In commentary for the DVD release of the
                                    second season of the show, Tork said that Dolenz was "incapable of repeating a triumph." Dolenz felt that once he had accomplished something and became a success at it, there was no artistic sense in repeating a formula.

                                    From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band the Monkees, created for the television situation comedy of the same name. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to
                                    the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered the "wool hat" guy, and called Nesmith back. Once he was cast, Screen Gems bought his songs so
                                    they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for the Monkees, such as "The Girl I Knew Somewhere", "Mary, Mary", and "Listen to the Band", became minor hits. One song he wrote, "You Just May Be the
                                    One", is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure. As part of a promotional deal, Gretsch guitar company built a one-off, natural-finish, 12-string electric guitar for Nesmith when he was
                                    performing with the Monkees. The custom-made guitar was frequently cited at that time as being worth $5,000 (the equivalent of $36,500 in 2018), which was undoubtedly inflated for publicity purposes. He earlier played
                                    a customized Gretsch 12-string, which had originally been a six-string model. Nesmith used this guitar for his appearances on the television series, as well as the Monkees' live appearances in 1966 and 1967. Beginning
                                    in 1968, Nesmith used a white six-string Gibson SG Custom for his live appearances with the Monkees. He used that guitar in their motion picture Head for the live version of "Circle Sky", and also for the final original
                                    Monkees tour in 1969. In a post on his Facebook page in 2011, Nesmith reported that both guitars were stolen in the early 1970s. As with the other Monkees, Nesmith came to be frustrated by the band's manufactured image.
                                    Nesmith was the most publicly vocal Monkee about the band's prefabricated image.[citation needed] The Monkees succeeded in ousting supervisor Don Kirshner and took control of their records and song choices, but they
                                    worked as a four-man group on only one album, 1967's Headquarters. Nesmith withheld many of his songs from the final Monkees albums, opting to release them on his post-Monkees solo records. During the band's first independent
                                    press conference, Nesmith called More of The Monkees "probably the worst record in the history of the world". The band never regained its credibility after fans learned they had not played the instruments on their earlier
                                    records. Sales still continued to be profitable until the disastrous release of the movie Head. Nesmith's last contractual Monkees commitment was a commercial for Kool-Aid and Nerf balls in April 1970 (fittingly, the
                                    spot ends with Nesmith frowning and saying, "Enerf's enerf!"). As the band's sales declined, Nesmith asked to be released from his contract, despite it costing him: "I had three years left ... at $150,000 [equivalent
                                    to $980,940 in 2018] a year."[citation needed] He remained in a financial bind until 1980, when he received his inheritance from the Liquid Paper Company. In a 1980 interview with Playboy, he said of that time: "I had
                                    to start telling little tales to the tax man while they were putting tags on the furniture. </div>

                                    From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal
                                    with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards.[14] Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer".[14]
                                    The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely
                                    on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz
                                    on drums). Mostly playing tambourine or maracas, Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards. The NBC television series the Monkees was popular, and remained in syndication. After the group disbanded
                                    in 1971, Jones reunited with Micky Dolenz as well as Monkees songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart in 1974 as a short-lived group called Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart.[14] A Monkees television show marathon ("Pleasant
                                    Valley Sunday") broadcast on 23 February 1986 by MTV resulted in a wave of Monkeemania not seen since the group's heyday. Jones reunited with Dolenz and Peter Tork from 1986 to 1989 to celebrate the band's renewed success
                                    and promote the 20th anniversary of the group. A new top 20 hit, "That Was Then, This Is Now" was released (though Jones did not perform on the song) as well as an album, Pool It!.[14] Monkees activity ceased until
                                    1996 when Jones reunited with Dolenz, Tork and Michael Nesmith to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band. The group released a new album entitled Justus, the first album since 1967's Headquarters that featured the
                                    band members performing all instrumental duties. It was the last time all four Monkees performed together.[14] In February 2011, Jones confirmed rumours of another Monkees reunion. "There's even talk of putting the
                                    Monkees back together again in the next year or so for a U.S. and UK tour," he told Disney's Backstage Pass newsletter. "You're always hearing all those great songs on the radio, in commercials, movies, almost everywhere."[15]
                                    The tour (Jones's last) came to fruition entitled, An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour.[16] Jones is the next closest member of the Monkees (to Micky Dolenz) who had worked with the band since its
                                    inception. The exceptions have been the new songs recorded in 1986 and since his death</div>

                                    In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was taught how
                                    to play properly. By the time the Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself.[5] He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes
                                    making his right leg weak. Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, writers of many of the Monkees' songs, observed quickly that when brought into the studio together, the four actors would try to make each other laugh. Because
                                    of this, the writers often brought in each singer individually. The antics escalated until one time Dolenz poured a cup of Coca-Cola on Don Kirshner's head; at the time, Dolenz did not know Kirshner on sight. According
                                    to Mike Nesmith, Dolenz's voice made the Monkees' sound distinctive,[6] and during tension-filled times, Nesmith and Peter Tork voluntarily turned over lead vocal duties to Dolenz on their own compositions.

                                    Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair and teeth were not photogenic.[11] When asked if he knew of someone with a similar "open, Nordic look",
                                    Stills suggested Tork should audition.[12] Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a pop band of the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom. Tork was the oldest member of the group. Tork
                                    was a proficient musician before he joined The Monkees, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he had played what he described as "third chair
                                    guitar" on Michael Nesmith's song "Papa Gene's Blues" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey
                                    Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake".

                                    From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band the Monkees, created for the television situation comedy of the same name. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to
                                    the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered the "wool hat" guy, and called Nesmith back. Once he was cast, Screen Gems bought his songs so
                                    they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for the Monkees, such as "The Girl I Knew Somewhere", "Mary, Mary", and "Listen to the Band", became minor hits. One song he wrote, "You Just May Be the
                                    One", is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure. As part of a promotional deal, Gretsch guitar company built a one-off, natural-finish, 12-string electric guitar for Nesmith when he was
                                    performing with the Monkees.  </div>

                                    with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards.[14] Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer".[14]
                                    The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely
                                    on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz
                                    on drums). Mostly playing tambourine or maracas, Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards. </div>

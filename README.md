User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

# The Monkees Website
This is my website for all Monkees fans around the world!
It showcases some of the greatest hits released by The Monkees over a career
spanning 50 years.
It also allows users to be kept informed by signing up to The Monkees newsletter
The prupose of my site is to attract new fans and give existing fans content which they will enjoy.

## UX
In designing my site I aimed to create a vibrant fun theme with lots of colours appropriate to the height of The Monkees popularity.
<br>I wanted users to easily be able to find what they were looking for by separating each topic into it's own section: band member profiles, photo's and so on.

## Features
### Existing Features
<b>Image carousel:</b> My site uses the Carousel component of Bootstrap to display images in one place with a user enabled control to move to the next/prev image.
<br><b>Navbar:</b> My site uses the Navbar component of Bootstrap to allow users to quickly acces what they are looking for - this navbar collapses when the screen size reduces.
<br><b>Grid system:</b> My site uses the Grid System of Bootstrap to allow responsive viewing when using different sized screens, or turning a tablet/mobile device from portrait to landscape.

### Features for the future
In the future I would like to add the video media to a carousel for better presentation.

## Technologies used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)

## Testing

### Colours
I researched colours popular in the sixties and also took inspiration from the music video "Daydream Believer".
<br>My two main colours used (for background colour and headings are Sunbeam (#fcdf64 yellow) and dark red (#9d2f3c)) - these colours run throughout my site.
<br>http://www.papersandpaints.co.uk/1960s-colours - inspiration for my colour pallete
<br>https://www.colorhexa.com - used to get the corresponding hexcode for my CSS stylesheet.

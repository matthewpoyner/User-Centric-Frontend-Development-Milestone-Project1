Tork was the oldest member of the group.","","Tork was a proficient musician before he joined The Monkees, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he had played what he described as \"third chair guitar\" on Michael Nesmith's song \"Papa Gene's Blues\" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, \"For Pete's Sake\". On the show, he was relegated to acting as the \"lovable dummy\", a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village.[13]","","The DVD release of the first season of the show contains commentary from the various bandmates. In it, Nesmith states that Tork was better at playing guitar than bass. In Tork's commentary, he states that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.","","Recording and producing as a group was Tork's major interest, and he hoped that the four members would continue working together as a band on future recordings. However, the four did not have enough in common regarding their musical interests. In commentary for the DVD release of the second season of the show, Tork said that Dolenz was \"incapable of repeating a triumph.\" Dolenz felt that once he had accomplished something and became a success at it, there was no artistic sense in repeating a formula."]}],[{"start":{"row":70,"column":24},"end":{"row":70,"column":27},"action":"remove","lines":["

teeth were not photogenic.[11] When asked if he knew of someone with a similar \"open, Nordic look\", Stills suggested Tork should audition.[12] Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a pop band of the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom. Tork was the oldest member of the group.","","Tork was a proficient musician before he joined The Monkees, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he had played what he described as \"third chair guitar\" on Michael Nesmith's song \"Papa Gene's Blues\" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, \"For Pete's Sake\". On the show, he was relegated to acting as the \"lovable dummy\", a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village.[13]","","The DVD release of the first season of the show contains commentary from the various bandmates. In it, Nesmith states that Tork was better at playing guitar than bass. In Tork's commentary, he states that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.","","Recording and producing as a group was Tork's major interest, and he hoped that the four members would continue working together as a band on future recordings. However, the four did not have enough in common regarding their musical interests. In commentary for the DVD release of the second season of the show, Tork said that Dolenz was \"incapable of repeating a triumph.\" Dolenz felt that once he had accomplished something and became a success at it, there was no artistic sense in repeating a formula.  </div>","                <div class=\"modal-footer\">","                    <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>","                </div>","            </div>","        </div>",""]},{"start":{"row":114,"column":4},"end":{"row":145,"column":20},"action":"insert","lines":["                    <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary   ptbutton\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#exampleModalLong\">","  Peter Tork","</button>","","                        <!-- Modal -->","                        <div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"exampleModalLong\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"exampleModalLongTitle\" aria-hidden=\"true\">","                            <div class=\"modal-dialog\" role=\"document\">","                                <div class=\"modal-content\">","                                    <div class=\"modal-header\">","                                        <h5 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"exampleModalLongTitle\">Micky Dolenz</h5>","                                        <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-label=\"Close\">","          <span aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</span>","        </button>","                                    </div>","                                    <div class=\"modal-body\">","                                        Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair and teeth were not photogenic.[11] When asked if he knew of someone with a similar \"open, Nordic look\",","                                        Stills suggested Tork should audition.[12] Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a pop band of the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom.

class=\"modal-body\">","                                        Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair and teeth were not photogenic.[11] When asked if he knew of someone with a similar \"open, Nordic look\",","                                        Stills suggested Tork should audition.[12] Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a pop band of the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom. Tork was the oldest member of the group.","                                        Tork was a proficient musician before he joined The Monkees, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he had played what he described as \"third","                                        chair guitar\" on Michael Nesmith's song \"Papa Gene's Blues\" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along","                                        with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, \"For Pete's Sake\". On the show, he was relegated to acting as the \"lovable dummy\", a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in","                                        New York's Greenwich Village.[13] The DVD release of the first season of the show contains commentary from the various bandmates. In it, Nesmith states that Tork was better at playing guitar than bass. In Tork's","                                        commentary, he states that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Dolenz","                                        taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards. Recording and producing as a group","                                        was Tork's major interest, and he hoped that the four members would continue working together as a band on future recordings. However, the four did not have enough in common regarding their musical interests. In","                                        commentary for the DVD release of the second season of the show, Tork said that Dolenz was \"incapable of repeating a triumph.\" Dolenz felt that once he had accomplished something and became a success at it, there","                                        was no artistic sense in repeating a formula. </div>","                                    <div

Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered the \"wool hat\" guy, and called Nesmith back.","","Once he was cast, Screen Gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for the Monkees, such as \"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\", \"Mary, Mary\", and \"Listen to the Band\", became minor hits. One song he wrote, \"You Just May Be the One\", is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure.","","As part of a promotional deal, Gretsch guitar company built a one-off, natural-finish, 12-string electric guitar for Nesmith when he was performing with the Monkees. The custom-made guitar was frequently cited at that time as being worth $5,000 (the equivalent of $36,500 in 2018), which was undoubtedly inflated for publicity purposes. He earlier played a customized Gretsch 12-string, which had originally been a six-string model. Nesmith used this guitar for his appearances on the television series, as well as the Monkees' live appearances in 1966 and 1967. Beginning in 1968, Nesmith used a white six-string Gibson SG Custom for his live appearances with the Monkees. He used that guitar in their motion picture Head for the live version of \"Circle Sky\", and also for the final original Monkees tour in 1969. In a post on his Facebook page in 2011, Nesmith reported that both guitars were stolen in the early 1970s.","","As with the other Monkees, Nesmith came to be frustrated by the band's manufactured image. Nesmith was the most publicly vocal Monkee about the band's prefabricated image.[citation needed]","","","The Monkees in 1966 (Nesmith at bottom right)","The Monkees succeeded in ousting supervisor Don Kirshner and took control of their records and song choices, but they worked as a four-man group on only one album, 1967's Headquarters. Nesmith withheld many of his songs from the final Monkees albums, opting to release them on his post-Monkees solo records. During the band's first independent press conference, Nesmith called More of The Monkees \"probably the worst record in the history of the world\". The band never regained its credibility after fans learned they had not played the instruments on their earlier records. Sales still continued to be profitable until the disastrous release of the movie Head.","","Nesmith's last contractual Monkees commitment was a commercial for Kool-Aid and Nerf balls in April 1970 (fittingly, the spot ends with Nesmith frowning and saying, \"Enerf's enerf!\"). As the band's sales declined, Nesmith asked to be released from his contract, despite it costing him: \"I had three years left ... at $150,000 [equivalent to $980,940 in 2018] a year.\"[citation needed] He remained in a financial bind until 1980, when he received his inheritance from the Liquid Paper Company. In a 1980 interview with Playboy, he said of that time: \"I had to start telling little tales to the tax man while they were putting tags on the furniture."]}],[{"start":{"row":188,"column":0},"end":{"row":188,"column":45},"action":"remove","lines":["The Monkees in 1966 (Nesmith at bottom right)"],"id":2197}],[{"start":{"row":186,"column":0},"end":{"row":187,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""],"id":2198},{"start":{"row":186,"column":0},"end":{"row":187,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""]}],[{"start":{"row":211,"column":0},"end":{"row":212,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["                        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Jones_(musician)\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn btn-primary djbutton\">Davy<br>Jones<br>WikiPage</a>",""],"id":2199},{"start":{"row":211,"column":0},"end":{"row":243,"column":30},"action":"insert","lines":["                        <!-- Button trigger modal -->","                        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary   ptbutton\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#ptModalLong\">","  Peter Tork","</button>","","                        <!-- Modal -->","                        <div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"ptModalLong\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"ptModalLongTitle\" aria-hidden=\"true\">","                            <div class=\"modal-dialog\" role=\"document\">","                                <div class=\"modal-content\">","                                    <div class=\"modal-header\">","                                        <h5 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"ptModalLongTitle\">Peter Tork</h5>","                                        <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-label=\"Close\">","          <span aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</span>","        </button>","                                    </div>","                                    <div class=\"modal-body\">","                                        Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair and teeth were not photogenic.[11] When asked if he knew of someone with a similar \"open, Nordic look\",","                                        Stills suggested Tork should audition.[12] Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a pop band of the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom.

Jones reunited with Dolenz and Peter Tork from 1986 to 1989 to celebrate the band's renewed success and promote the 20th anniversary of the group. A new top 20 hit, \"That Was Then, This Is Now\" was released (though Jones did not perform on the song) as well as an album, Pool It!.[14]","","Monkees activity ceased until 1996 when Jones reunited with Dolenz, Tork and Michael Nesmith to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band.
